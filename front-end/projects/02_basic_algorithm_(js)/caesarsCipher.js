/*
One of the simplest and most widely known ciphers is a Caesar cipher, also known as a shift cipher. In a shift cipher the meanings of the letters are shifted by some set amount.

A common modern use is the ROT13 cipher, where the values of the letters are shifted by 13 places. Thus 'A' ↔ 'N', 'B' ↔ 'O' and so on.

Write a function which takes a ROT13 encoded string as input and returns a decoded string.

All letters will be uppercase. Do not transform any non-alphabetic character (i.e. spaces, punctuation), but do pass them on.

function rot13(str) {
    // Split str into a character array
    return str.split('')
        // Iterate over each character in the array
        .map.call(str, function (char) {
            // Convert char to a character code
            x = char.charCodeAt(0);
            // Checks if character lies between A-Z
            if (x < 65 || x > 90) {
                return String.fromCharCode(x);  // Return un-converted character
            }
            //N = ASCII 78, if the character code is less than 78, shift forward 13 places
            else if (x < 78) {
                return String.fromCharCode(x + 13);
            }
            // Otherwise shift the character 13 places backward
            return String.fromCharCode(x - 13);
        }).join('');  // Rejoin the array into a string
}

console.log(rot13("SERR PBQR PNZC"));
