/*
Return true if the string in the first element of the array contains all of the letters of the string in the second element of the array.

For example, ["hello", "Hello"], should return true because all of the letters in the second string are present in the first, ignoring case.

The arguments ["hello", "hey"] should return false because the string "hello" does not contain a "y".

Lastly, ["Alien", "line"], should return true because all of the letters in "line" are present in "Alien".

First we make the two strings in the array lowercase. test will hold what we are looking for in target.
Then we loop through our test characters and if any of them is not found we return false.

If they are all found, the loop will finish without returning anything and we get to return true.
