/*
Return true if the string in the first element of the array contains all of the letters of the string in the second element of the array.

For example, ["hello", "Hello"], should return true because all of the letters in the second string are present in the first, ignoring case.

The arguments ["hello", "hey"] should return false because the string "hello" does not contain a "y".

Lastly, ["Alien", "line"], should return true because all of the letters in "line" are present in "Alien".

/*
Grab the second string, lowercase and turn it into an array; then make sure every one of its letters is a part of the lowercased first string.

Every will basically give you letter by letter to compare, which we do by using indexOf on the first string. indexOf will give you -1 if the current letter is missing. We check that not to be the case, for if this happens even once every will be false.
