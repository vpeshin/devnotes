Write a function that splits an array (first argument) into groups the length of size (second argument) and returns them as a two-dimensional array.

/*
Firstly, we create two variables. newArr is an empty array which we will push to. We also have the i variable set to zero, for use in our while loop.
Our while loop loops until i is equal to or more than the length of the array in our test.
Inside our loop, we push to the newArr array using arr.slice(i, i+size). For the first time it loops, it will look something like:

newArr.push(arr.slice(1, 1+2))

After we push to newArr, we add the variable of size onto i.
Finally, we return the value of newArr.
